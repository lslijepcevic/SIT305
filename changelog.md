Week 6, 15th-16th of April
* Amin: I add this feature to the background that changes the color during the game from light blue to Dark blue. But I could not upload my changes yet which I will fix on the next week.
Week 7, Monday 15/April
* Feedback: I feel your project is falling very behind, and you're not putting in enough time to pass. I seem to be logging in to your repository more than either of you. [Henry]
* Feedback: Show me 10-14 hours each per week.. where was it spent? I'd like you to start writing the time taken per changelog item (in brackets at the end of each line), so that you can see where time is being spent / not being spent enough. [Henry]
Week 7, Tuesday 16/April
* Leon: Force pushed different program. Jump, double jump work on button tap, ranged attack button added which spawns a bullet that moves positively along x axis.
* Leon: Was also able to create a spawner that sends out enemies at random timer intervals. For later levels the timer will be reduced.
[Amin]: Week 1 and 2: At week one and two, Leon and I discussed features that we want to implement in our application and also we had researched about choosing programming environment and programming language which we choose Unity and C#. During week one and two, we spent several hours researching and discussing our common project.(8 to 10 hours).
[Amin]: Week 3: At week three I create scrolling background with several elements which shows our application looks like endless running. for this purpose, I add all object and create MoveLeftCycle.cs script which moves all elements from the left side of the scene to the right side with different speeds then repeat this action for an unlimited time. for this script, I had lots of research and for testing, before the final result, I created several prototypes. Leon was a great help during this week and help me to fix bugs for a better result.(6 to 8 hours for researching and implementing).
[Amin]: Week 4: During week 4, I worked on the character and its behavior. I add my character and make an animation for moving character. This part was not related to the programming part but was necessary for our game. Then I add a button for jumping and bending and create bodyControl.cs for scripting these two buttons. Then I create GameControl.cs and add function for boosting time and when time is spent, the character running faster and faster. the next step was creating a current score and high score which show as text input in the top left of the screen. (13 to 15 hours for researching and implementing).
[Amin]: Week 5: During week five, I start to work on enemies and find a solution to how to spawning enemies and about enemies behavior in our game. First I added our enemy's character, then with 3 different scripts, spawn our enemy in random time and different positions and also made collision detection between main character and enemy. Then add the restart button and when a collision occurs and when a user clicks on the restart button, a user can play again. (15 hours for researching, testing, and implementing).
[Amin]: Week 6: During the last five weeks, All main features were implemented by Leon and me. At week six, I create a timer script and then added that timer to my background which related directly to the main camera. Then according to that timer script, I could change background color from light blue to dark blue during the game to simulate day and night. (6 to 8 hours for researching, testing, debugging, and implementing).
[Amin]: Week 7,study week: On week seven, [Leon and I faced with a conflict with combining our code. So we decided to upload the second version of our game besides of our previous version], then during study week and week eight combining both of them to single project and add more features. After fixing our problem I want to create an intro menu and link that to the main scene. (Determined from 10 to 15 hours work on it for troubleshooting and adding more features)
[Amin]: Week 7,study week: Finally, we could troubleshoot our conflicts and make our project as a single project. we changed some features and add other features during week 7 and study week. Now our project looks more professional, including core features. All bugs and conflicts are solved and we going to make our game better and better. Till the end of study week, we have our start menu and we can play with our character. our character can jump and shoot to enemies and kill them. we have a very nice 8 bits environment for background, character, and enemies. Game's enemies spawning randomly and our character have an animation to move and jump and shooting. We have an intro menu with two buttons, one is a toggling panel to show how we can play the game and another button is start button. When a user clicks on the start button, scene automatically switch to the game scene and the player can start to play a game. (15 to 18 hours to troubleshooting, solving conflicts, researching, creating start menu, link scenes, and testing).
[Amin]: Week 8, On this week I working on game sound and write a general script which I can add to my buttons to load sound effect from the audio folder. and also I write a script for background music which is continuable where the game is switching to different pages.Two levels of the random generating platform added to the project which a user can jump on to the second or third level of the platform (12 hours for researching, implementing, and debugging).
[Amin]: Week 8, Till now all major features added to the game and just some bonus features will add to the game which makes the game more interesting.

Week 9, Wednesday 8/May [Henry]
* Good progress. Glad to see it's getting closer. Final stretch now.
* Make sure you go over everything in the Grading Criteria super carefully, to ensure you meet each point.
[Amin]: Weeks 9-10, During weeks 9 and 10 we try to testing game and play for a long time to understand about probable bugs or technical issues and trying to add new bonus features for the final submission.
